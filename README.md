# loweralphanotation

loweralphanotation is a Compiler and IDE for an Assembler called "Alpha Notation".

It was developed by Maximilian S., Jan M. and Sirko H. for the University of Bonn, Institue of Computer Science (Lecture: "Systemnahe Informatik").

Forks and Pullrequests are welcome.

Note: We developed this Software BEFORE the Lecture "Softwaretechnologie", so some code parts might be seem "strange".

This version currently is stable and should run without any problems. If you find any bugs, please let us know.

If you are running the jar file from the Terminal, don't mind the printings.

If someone is interested in porting this project for the web-browser, let me(Max) know.

And by the way, If someone wants to help us to translate the software, please message us.
