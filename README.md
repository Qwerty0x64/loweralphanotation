# loweralphanotation

loweralphanotation is a Compiler and IDE for an Assembler called "Alpha Notation".

It was developed by Maximilian S., Jan M. and Sirko H. for the University of Bonn, Institue of Computer Science (Lecture: "Systemnahe Informatik / System-Oriented Computer Science").

Forks and Pullrequests are welcome.

Note: We developed this Software BEFORE the Lecture "Softwaretechnologie / Software Engineering", so some code parts might be seem "strange".

This version currently is stable and should run without any problems. If you find any bugs, please let us know.

If someone is interested in porting this project for the web-browser, let me(Max) know.

And by the way, If someone wants to help us to translate the software, please message us.

Important Note:
The current runnable jar file is compiled with the newest java version (9). It's not compatible with older java version. Update your jre or compile it yourself on your machine.

Windows users are forced to have at least windows 8 because of the default charset of windows 7 (ansi) and 8+ (utf8)!
